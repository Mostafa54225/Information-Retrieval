As you stand upon the edge
Hanging in the balance
And fate may fall down upon you
While the devil is knocking
So all you restless
Each night you hear the drums of war (hear the drums of war)
Awaken, awaken
The voice begins to call you while you hunger (while you hunger)
A taste of destiny you're searching for
Awaken, awaken, awaken
